Topic: Scrpit Writing in Linux.


In this portion we learn about the linux shell script and how to create and execute it. Now, Our first question is that.

1) What is Script? 
	-> Basically a script is program which is execute on the linux terminal. 
	-> On the word of online:  A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell which could be one of the following 

		-> The Bourne Shell
		-> The C Shell
		-> The Korn Shell
		-> The GNU Bourne-Again Shell

2) What is the file extensions for the shell script?
	-> The shall script basically know as a "Bash Script". From those word we took the last two digit of the word "Bash". And finally we got our script extension. That is ".sh"

		Example:  test.sh (It's a script file example).

3) How can we Create and run the script file on our Command?
	-> For writing a script into our linux terminal. At first we create a shell script file. Here the file Name is: "test.sh"
	     Now open the file into any of editor(graphical or command line). Here I use vim editor. Now open the file by writing command
			-> vi test.sh; Then press ENTER and press "i" for insert text. Write your command now, here I write the following 
			   commands on the terminal

				echo This is my first script.
				touch <filename.txt>  [Replace the file name on your choice.]
				ls
				chmod 777 <file_name> [Replace the file name which you create before.]
				echo The script is end here...
	
	Now press on "esc" key then press " shift + ; " key and type "wq". [Here, w -> Write & q-> Quit]. Then press "Enter". 
	
	Now change the file permission. Here we give the "execute permission" for the user. So our command is that:
		-> chomd 744 <file_name>  or chmod u+x <file_name>

	Run your first script
		-> ./test.sh
